## Learning Objectives

- A strategy for exploratory data analysis for multiple linear regression.

- Chapter 9.

## Brain Size

- What variables are associated with brain weight?

- Collected information on 96 different species.

- We know that body weight is already associated with brain weight, 
    
    - So what variables are associated with brain weight **after controlling for body weight**.

- Possible variables: Body weight (kg), gestation period (days), litter size

## Brain Size

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(Sleuth3)
data("case0902")
head(case0902)
```

## Scatterplots

- The first step is almost always **making a ton of scatterplots**.

- Plots of the response against each explanatory variable shows us what variables seems to be **marginally** related to the response.

- "Marginally related" = related **un**conditional on other variables.

## Response against each explanatory variable

```{r, echo = TRUE}
qplot(Body, Brain, data = case0902)
```

## Response against each explanatory variable

```{r, echo = TRUE}
qplot(Gestation, Brain, data = case0902)
```

## Response against each explanatory variable

```{r, echo = TRUE}
qplot(Litter, Brain, data = case0902)
```


## Response against each explanatory variable

- Curvature and different spreads at each explanatory variable suggest a log transformation of `Brain`.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
case0902$logBrain <- log(case0902$Brain)
```

## Response against each explanatoery variable

```{r, echo = TRUE}
qplot(Body, logBrain, data = case0902)
```

## Response against each explanatory variable

```{r, echo = TRUE}
qplot(Gestation, logBrain, data = case0902)
```

## Response against each explanatory variable

```{r, echo = TRUE}
qplot(Litter, logBrain, data = case0902)
```

## Response against each explanatory variable

- Still a lot of curvature, so it looks like logging each variable might help.

```{r}
case0902$logBody      <- log(case0902$Body)
case0902$logGestation <- log(case0902$Gestation)
case0902$logLitter    <- log(case0902$Litter)
```

## Response against each explanatory variable

```{r, echo = TRUE}
qplot(logBody, logBrain, data = case0902)
```

## Response against each explanatory variable

```{r, echo = TRUE}
qplot(logGestation, logBrain, data = case0902)
```

## Response against each explanatory variable

```{r, echo = TRUE}
qplot(logLitter, logBrain, data = case0902)
```

## Response against each explanatory variable

- There looks like there is a lot of linearity now.

## Explanatory variables against each other

- It is often useful to look at scatterplots between each pair of explanatory variables.

- This tells us if some variables seem to be picking up a lot of the same information 

- E.g. Gestation period might be larger just because body size is larger.

    - If brain is associated with Gestation, it might only be through body.
    
## Explanatory variables against each other

```{r, echo = TRUE}
qplot(logBody, logGestation, data = case0902)
```


## Explanatory variables against each other

```{r, echo = TRUE}
qplot(logBody, logLitter, data = case0902)
```

## Explanatory variables against each other

```{r, echo = TRUE}
qplot(logGestation, logLitter, data = case0902)
```

## Matrix Plots

- You can show scatterplots between all variables at the same time.

- This is called a matrix plot (or a pairs plot).

## Matrix Plots

```{r, echo = TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(GGally)
ggpairs(case0902, columns = 6:9)
```


## Make an initial fit

- We can first fit a very complicated model and check residuals.

- We would be looking for more curvature and outliers.
\small
```{r, echo = TRUE}
lm_comp <- lm(logBrain ~ logBody * logLitter * logGestation,
              data = case0902)
res_vec <- resid(lm_comp)
fit_vec <- fitted(lm_comp)
```

## Make an initial fit

```{r, echo = TRUE}
qplot(fit_vec, res_vec) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0)
```

\normalsize

## Residual qq-plot

```{r, echo = TRUE}
qplot(sample = res_vec, geom = "qq") +
  geom_qq_line()
```


## Coded scatterplot

- If you want to explore the association between three quantitative variables, you can code one of them by **transparency** (more preferrable) or **size** (less preferrable)

## Coded scatterplot

```{r, echo = TRUE}
qplot(logBody, logBrain, alpha = logGestation,
      data = case0902)
```

## Coded Scatterplots

```{r, echo = TRUE}
qplot(logBody, logBrain, size = logGestation,
      data = case0902)
```

## Coded Scatterplots

- If you have categorical explanatory variables, you can code their levels by **colors** (more preferrable) and **shapes** (less preferrable) and include this on a scatterplot of two quantitative variables

## Coded Scatterplots

```{r, echo = TRUE}
data("case0901")
case0901$Time <- as.factor(case0901$Time)
qplot(Intensity, Flowers, color = Time,
      data = case0901)
```

## Coded Scatterplots

```{r, echo = TRUE}
qplot(Intensity, Flowers, shape = Time,
      data = case0901)
```

## Coded Scatterplots

- It's polite to use colorblind safe color palattes

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(ggthemes)
qplot(Intensity, Flowers, color = Time,
      data = case0901) +
  scale_color_colorblind()
```
